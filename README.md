# Interactive-Moodspace



Idea 1: Interactive Moodscape

Concept: Users' input shapes a dynamic, abstract environment. They answer simple questions about their mood, and the site generates a shifting landscape of color, form, and subtle ambient sound that reflects those emotions.
UI/UX:
Minimalist starting page, focus on evocative questions.
The "Moodscape" evolves smoothly, perhaps influenced by mouse movement or keyboard input.
Emphasis on seamless transitions, organic shapes, and a calming color palette
